           <span class="drop-cap">T</span>
           <p class="pd-pgh">he storage, preparation and distribution of food in childcare facilities present some unique challenges for children and staff alike. With numerous opportunities for cross-contamination and food-borne illnesses and the potential of germs entering from other areas of the daycare, the food preparation area is the vulnerable "nerve center" of the facility. As a result, stringent protocols must be implemented to assure safe food handling and healthy, contaminant-free meals. </p>

           <h4>Infection preventive outbreak control <br> strategies</h4>
           <span class="drop-cap">S</span>
           <p class="pd-pgh">everal risk factors that contribute to a potentially severe outbreak of disease are inherent with childcare centers. Such an outbreak would spread rapidly due to children’s habits of handling and sucking foreign objects, the high number of occupants and the close physical proximity typically found in daycares. 
           Childcare managers must have a comprehensive understanding of the potential for disease propagation during an outbreak to be able to take the necessary steps to contain or eradicate the disease.  </p>

                <h4> Infection preventive diapering</h4>
                <span class="drop-cap">T</span>
                <p class="pd-pgh">he diapering area can easily be the most contaminated zone in a daycare center. Common communicable gastrointestinal diseases can be passed from person to person, even if no symptoms of the illness are present. In fact, norovirus and rotavirus are continually excreted through feces for at least 30-60 days after symptoms have ceased.</p>

                <h4> Infection preventive cleaning of bodily <br> fluids</h4>
                <span class="drop-cap">C</span>
                <p class="pd-pgh">hildcare facilities cope with a daily battle of bodily fluids that might be regarded as dangerous biohazards in other industries. The little "bundles of joy" in daycares cause a set of circumstances that pose serious health risks to the facilities’ children, employees and their expanded social networks. Furthermore, one does not need to make direct contact with bodily fluids of a sick individual for pathogens to be passed on. If vomit and fecal episodes aren't disinfected properly or remain unattended for an extended time, the pathogens will become airborne and spread to other surfaces and individuals.</p>
