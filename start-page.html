                    <p>or child care facility operators, understanding why infections run rampant through daycare settings isn't difficult. The unhygienic behaviors of children, greater crowding, and the susceptibility of children’s immune systems to infection are constant challenges  <br>Then there are the issues of vaccination abstention and the undeveloped immune systems in babies and young children. All these factors lead to higher infection rates among children attending childcare facilities —a fact that researchers have documented for decades in multiple settings.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-headings">Scientific Fact:</h4>
                    <ul >
                        <li>Wald et al found that children attending child care centers had a 51% higher rate of infection, and 134% more days of illness, as compared to children cared for at home.</li>
                        <li>Swedish children in child care required 40 to 80% more medical consultations for acute infections than children who remained at home</li>
                        <li>A Danish study reported a 69% higher incidence of hospitalizations among children in daycare for acute respiratory infection compared with children in home care.</li>

                    <p>The negative health effects of childhood infection can extend beyond theinitial acute phase of illness. Although, in the majority of cases, infectionsresolve without interfering with later development, the consequences of increased poor health are not so simple.Respiratory infections and obstructed airways are a major cause of hospitalization and morbidity in small children and can lead to reduced lung function among children later in life.Otitis media - or middle ear infection - can have adverse consequences in children under 3 years old even when treated properly, including reduced <br>
                    reading comprehension and compromised cognitive ability. Daycare attendance has been cited as one of the leading risk factors for the onset of middle ear infection.Children who attend daycare also have an increased risk of urgent medical attention as a result of rotavirus infection. Rotaviruses are thought to be responsible for between 20% and 60% of hospital admissions in children.Additionally, varicella - a cause of chickenpox and shingles - is often considered a benign childhood disease, but can result in complications as serious as hospitalization or even death.</p>

                    <p>Infectious diseases are, by definition, transmitted from person-to-person. The increased risk of infection within childcare facilities extends far beyondthe children in attendance, and puts adults in contact with them at greaterrisk too.Working in the childcare sector carries significant occupational risk for caregivers, including exposure to diseases like Hepatitis A, CMV, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Meningitis, Scabies, Pediculosis, and Herpes.A 1996 cross-sectional study found that 62% of childcare workers had contracted CMV; the majority of whom were of childbearing age. The risk of infection from children under their care is of serious concern, especially for those who may be pregnant.CMV is a leading cause of congenital infection transmitted by preschool children to their peers, parents, and caregivers. Babies born with the virus may suffer central nervous system abnormalities, growth restrictions, andjaundice. Up to 90% of young CMV survivors endure serious long-termhealth issues, including visual impairment and decreased neurological function</p>
